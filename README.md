# Music-Genre Classification Project

This project was part of a Kaggle competition organized by SHAI For AI, aimed at building a model to classify music tracks into one of 10 different genres. The dataset includes a variety of features related to music tracks such as Popularity, Artist Name, Track Name, Valence, Tempo, Modality, Liveness, Danceability, Speechiness, Acousticness, and more.
### Key Features:
Data Complexity: The dataset contains missing values and skewed feature distributions, requiring extensive data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection to ensure optimal * * model performance *.
Class Imbalance: Addressing the challenge of uneven genre distribution across the dataset.
Algorithm Selection: After experimenting with multiple algorithms, CatBoost was selected as the best model, significantly improving accuracy from 58% to 73%.
Model Optimization: Used GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning to further enhance the model's performance.
This project demonstrates the full pipeline of data exploration, feature engineering, model building, and optimization, showcasing a robust approach to multi-class classification in the context of music genre prediction.
